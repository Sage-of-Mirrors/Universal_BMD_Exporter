# Universal_BMD_Exporter
A program designed to use Assimp (Open Asset Import Library) to convert a wide range of models into the BMD format.

BMD (short for Binary MoDel) is the model format used in many of Nintendo's games from the GameCube on, including Super Mario Sunshine, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Super Mario Galaxy. There is also BDL (short for Binary moDeL), which is just the BMD format with an added section for pre-compiled FIFO instructions. This exporter, for the forseeable future, only supports conversion to BMD.
